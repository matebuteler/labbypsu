# LabbyPSU

An easy-to-make, DIY, powerful lab power supply for the hobbyist.
Made from parts most people have laying around (that would otherwise turn into e-waste).

# Specs
Specs depend on the hardware you use to build it, but a typical build is expected to output up to 38V on its output.

# Concept
We all have old power bricks laying around, right? Well, just put them in series, hook them up to a DC-DC regulator, and you've got a heavy duty PSU.
